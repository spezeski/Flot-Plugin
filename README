 *  Requirements: jquery.flot.navigate ( set zoom : {interactive: false})

This plugin enables panning and zooming of individual data series.
Hovering over a Y axis label will allow you to pan the respective series by dragging along the axis, and zoom on the Y axis using the mouse wheel.
Hovering over the plot itself will allow panning of all series, and zooming on the X axis.
This is behavior is not yet configurable.

Issues:
   * Sometimes the plugin takes a long time to kick in
TODO:
   * Add more options to control the behavior
   * Add control to the x-axis
