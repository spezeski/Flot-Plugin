 *  Requirements: jquery.flot.navigate

This plugin enables panning and zooming of individual data series.

To use it, call plot.drawAxisDivs().  This is necessary because there was not an approprate hook to bind to.

Hovering over a Y axis label will allow you to pan the respective series by dragging along the axis, and zoom on the Y axis using the mouse wheel.
Hovering over the X axis label will allow you to pan all series along the X axis by dragging and zoom along the X axis by using the mouse wheel.
Hovering over the plot itself will allow panning and zooming of all series on the X and Y axes.
This is behavior is not yet configurable.

Tips:
   * Set the labelWidth properties of the axes
   * Set zoom : {interactive: false} for the navigation plugin
TODO:
   * Add options to control the behavior
