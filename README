 *  Requirements: jquery.flot.navigate

This plugin enables panning and zooming of individual data series.

Hovering over a Y axis label will allow you to pan the respective series by dragging along the axis, and zoom on the Y axis using the mouse wheel.
Hovering over the plot itself will allow panning of all series, and zooming on the X axis.
This is behavior is not yet configurable.

Tips:
   * Set the labelWidth properties of the axes
   * Set zoom : {interactive: false} for the navigation plugin
Issues:
   * The plugin hooks on drawOverlay, which in some cases needs to triggered manually with triggerRedrawOverlay();
TODO:
   * Add more options to control the behavior
   * Add control to the x-axis
